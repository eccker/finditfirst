        "Xolotl is associated with the idea of movement and life, according to the well-known legend of the fifth sun; but in a very peculiar way.",

        "The Aztecs believed that after the gods Nanahuatzin and Tecuciztecatl had respectively become the Sun and the Moon by throwing themselves at the stake in the sacred city of Teotihuacan, the gods realized that the sun and the moon were immobile. -How can we make the Sun and the Moon live?- the gods wondered. -Let us all die!- they decided -Let the Sun and the Moon rise again through our death.",
